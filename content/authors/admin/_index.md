Hello! My name is Courtney Lee and I’m interested in crafting stories with and from data. I enjoy drawing from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives to show impacts for broad audiences. My most frequently used methods are statistical data analysis (descriptive and regressions) and historical research, which I then carefully weave together to form a narrative.

Most days of the week, I am a research associate at the Public Policy Institute of California’s Higher Education Center. I study the topics of affordability, access, and completion to and through higher education very closely.  Some publications I have written include bits on [California’s financial aid](https://www.ppic.org/publication/state-financial-aid-in-california/), state level strategies to [reduce student debt](https://www.ppic.org/blog/state-level-strategies-to-reduce-student-debt/), and [non-tuition fees](http://www.ppic.org/blog/rising-cost-college-student-fees/). 

Prior to becoming a policy researcher, I worked in evaluation and operations at ScholarMatch, a college access nonprofit based in San Francisco, dabbled in computer vision at an applied mathematics summer program, and interned at the Los Angeles Times’ Data Desk. I hold a BS in mathematics with a minor in statistics from UCLA.
